## Weather Application

These files showcase my ability to create a beginner/intermediate project with an API. It was a success and I wanted somewhere to post these files for prosperity.

This application comes with a search function, a clean, usable UI, temperature of requested city, what the temperature feels like, humidity, brief description and wind speed.

This project was started on 20/05/2025 and was completed on 22/05/2025.

### Getting Started
These files aren't really meant to 'work' out the gate, and I won't ever be developing a .exe for it, the program simply isn't that complex to justify. A future project will have one though... To make sure it's working, download the code, run it in your coding environment and boot it up. 

### Known bugs
- Known bugs:
  - Weather will not be shown for any city with the same name that is not as 'relevant' (defined as size/population) as the most popular one. E.G: Search query 'Cleaveland' will ONLY show Cleaveland, Ohio and never Cleaveland, Queensland.
 
### Features Planned
- Ai bot to give you a summary of your upcoming week.
- Saving data to a CSV.
- More relevant image selection (code already implimented, need a website hosting these images though).
  - If anyone has a website that can query publicly available photos for cities, let me know. The original plan was to use Source Unsplashed. However they're recently(?) rolled out significant changes to their API structure, requiring login, monitoring of your project and further additional restrictions. If anyone knows of one, drop me a comment!
